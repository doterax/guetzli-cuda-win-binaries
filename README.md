# Introduction

Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high
visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than
images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates only
sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.

# About this Repo
Guetzli is an awesome jpeg encoder, however, it works a little bit slow. In order to speed it up, we have added CUDA support for Guetzli, optimized some procedure.

This repository if only for binary releases. Check Releases section.
