# Introduction

Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high
visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than
images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates only
sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.

# About this Repo
Guetzli is an awesome jpeg encoder, however, it works a little bit slow. In order to speed it up, [we have added](https://github.com/ianhuang-777/guetzli-cuda-opencl) CUDA support for Guetzli, optimized some procedure.

This repository is only for binary distribution. Please check Releases section.
